# Robust Prediction Intervals for Valuation of Large Portfolios of Variable Annuities: A comparative Study of Five Models

In this article, we explored the generation of robust prediction intervals for variable annuity pricing using five distinct models enhanced by bootstrapping techniques. Our analysis revealed that the Gradient Boosting Regression model offers the most optimal balance between interval narrowness and coverage rate, making it the recommended approach for accurate valuation of large variable annuity portfolios.
